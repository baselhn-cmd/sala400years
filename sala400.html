            <p>It is great to hear that Sala is celebrating its 400th anniversary in 2024 with so much joy and commitment. It is an
            impressive milestone in the city's history. Celebrating and paying attention to the historical events and transformation
            of the city is a beautiful gesture.
            
            It is also encouraging that Sala 400 years focuses on safety, sustainability and inclusion in its activities. Being
            KRAN-branded and prioritizing tap water and sustainability are important steps towards a more environmentally friendly
            and conscious celebration. It is pleasing to hear that the anniversary year will offer a variety of events and
            activities for everyone who is part of Sala or wants to visit the city.
            
            I hope that Sala 400 years will be a memorable and successful event that creates many positive memories and experiences
            for the residents and visitors. Happy celebrations, and I hope it will be a memorable anniversary year!</p>
