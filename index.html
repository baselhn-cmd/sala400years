                <p>This underground hotel suite, located 155 meters (508 feet) below the surface in the Swedish town of Sala, was
                originally carved out by miners over a decade using a method known as fire-setting. It's part of a historic silver mine
                that operated for four centuries. Today, you can enjoy a unique and comfortable stay in this space, complete with a
                double bed, silver decor, and champagne.
                
                While the surrounding tunnels maintain a chilly 2°C (35°F), the hotel room itself is kept at a cozy 18°C (64°F). Please
                note that there is no cell phone service in the mine, but you can use an intercom to reach the on-call staff for any
                assistance you may need during your stay.
                
                As of July 2020, both the mine and hotel are temporarily closed for renovations, and they plan to reopen afterward.</p>

                <p>Jan-Erik Swennberg's love for Turkey led to the creation of a backyard mini-city near Sala, Sweden. Diagnosed with
                    Asperger's Syndrome at a young age, Jan-Erik developed an intense passion for Turkey, particularly Istanbul, during
                    a
                    trip in 1979. This fascination inspired him to recreate Istanbul's iconic buildings in his family garden. What makes
                    this mini-city unique is that it's entirely based on Jan-Erik's personal perspective, without any formal plans or
                    blueprints. He used salvaged materials from local sources to construct around 20 model buildings, including the
                    Sultan
                    Ahmed Mosque (Blue Mosque), Dolmabahçe Palace, and more. Despite initial skepticism from his father, the mini-city
                    was
                    well-received, and it remains an impressive testament to Jan-Erik's dedication to his Turkish passion.</p>
